## Overview

This document summarizes my learning experience and hands-on work throughout the NASA course, which covered both network administration and system administration topics, was designed to build practical skills through weekly labs aligned with each lecture topic. I have gained some experience configuring real-world systems and networks throughout the course.

## Network Administration (Weeks One to Eight)

In the first half of the course, I learned the fundamentals of networking, including IP addressing, IPv6, and the five-layer network model. I practiced setting up physical network cables and verifying connectivity.

Next, I studied the Unix operating system, focusing on command-line tools, file permissions, and access control lists. I practiced writing and executing shell scripts for system automation.

Later, I learned about partitioning disks, using Logical Volume Manager (LVM), creating filesystems, and setting up software RAID. I performed hands-on disk management tasks in a virtual environment.

The course then introduced advanced features of Cisco switches, such as virtual LANs and clustering. I configured VLANs to manage network segmentation and communication.

In the fifth week, I explored virtualization technologies, including KVM, LXC, and Docker. I created and managed virtual machines and containers using tools like virsh and Docker Compose.

I then focused on IP-level networking tools such as ifconfig, route, ip, iptables, nslookup, and arp. I learned to configure firewall rules and monitor network activity using OPNsense.

Before the midterm, I studied Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Network Address Translation (NAT), and Virtual Private Networks (VPN). I set up a DNS server and tested VPN functionality.

All of these concepts were evaluated in a midterm exam that included practical and theoretical components.

## System Administration (Weeks Nine to Seventeen)

In the second half of the course, I transitioned to system administration topics. I learned about the Linux kernel, package management, and setting up LDAP for centralized authentication. I practiced managing packages and configuring an LDAP server.

Following that, I studied system logging and configuration. I learned how to set up network interfaces, assign IP addresses, and use system logs to debug network issues. I also implemented a Network File System (NFS) to enable file sharing across systems.

Later, I learned about wireless networking, including the physical and link layers, and the 802.11 standard. I participated in a wireless lab using Wi-Fi configuration tools.

I also explored web server deployment, specifically using nginx. I configured and tested a web server to handle HTTP traffic.

Toward the end of the course, we focused on security. I learned about both network and system-level security, including detecting threats, applying firewall rules, monitoring logs, and securing user access.

The course concluded with a final exam to assess my overall understanding, followed by a guest lecture from an industry expert sharing insights from the field.

## Final Reflection

This course significantly enhanced my technical knowledge and practical skills in both networking and system administration. I learned how to build and secure systems from the ground up, and I applied these skills in a series of structured, hands-on labs. The balance between theory and practice helped me develop confidence and independence in solving real-world IT problems.
